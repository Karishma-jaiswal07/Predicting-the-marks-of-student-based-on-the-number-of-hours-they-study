This code is a Python script for a simple machine learning task to predict scores based on the number of hours studied. Let's go through the code step-by-step to understand its functionality:
Importing Libraries: The script starts by importing the necessary Python libraries: pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for plotting, and a magic command %matplotlib inline for inline plotting in Jupyter Notebooks.
Importing Data: The script reads the data from a CSV file named "Data.csv" using the pandas read_csv function and assigns it to the variable data. It then prints "Importing Data Successfully" to indicate that the data has been imported.
Checking Imported Data: The script prints the first 10 rows of the data using data.head(10) to verify whether the data has been imported correctly.
Pie Chart Plot: Next, it attempts to plot a pie chart using data.plot.pie() which is not suitable for the given dataset. A pie chart is typically used to represent the proportion of different categories within a whole, not for visualizing numerical data like hours and scores. The code will generate an incorrect plot.
Data Preparation: The script then prepares the data for training the machine learning model. It separates the independent variable (Hours) and the dependent variable (Scores) into X and y variables, respectively.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from the sklearn.model_selection module.
Model Training: The script uses linear regression as the machine learning algorithm to train the model on the training data using LinearRegression from the sklearn.linear_model module.
Testing the Model: The script prints the test data (X_test) and predicts the scores (y_pred) based on the test data using the trained linear regression model.
Model Evaluation: The script creates a DataFrame (df) to compare the actual scores (y_test) with the predicted scores (y_pred). It then calculates the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) using metrics.mean_absolute_error() from the sklearn.metrics module, which measures the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted scores.
Custom Input: The script provides an example of making a custom prediction using the trained model. It uses hours = [[9.25]] as the input (hours of study) to predict the corresponding score.
Overall, this code performs a basic linear regression task to predict scores based on the number of hours studied. It evaluates the model's performance using MAE and provides a way to make custom predictions. However, the pie chart plotting for this data is incorrect and doesn't make sense. If you want to visualize the relationship between hours and scores, a scatter plot or a line plot would be more appropriate.
